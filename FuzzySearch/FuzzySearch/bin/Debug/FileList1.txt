Transparent data encryption enables you to encrypt sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, stored in table columns. 
Encrypted data is transparently decrypted for a database user who has access to the data. 
Transparent data encryption helps protect data stored on media in the event that the storage media or data file gets stolen.
Oracle Database 11g uses authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to secure data in the database, but not in the operating system data files where data is stored. 
To protect these data files, Oracle Database provides transparent data encryption. Transparent data encryption encrypts sensitive table data stored in data files. 
To prevent unauthorized decryption, transparent data encryption stores the encryption keys in a security module external to the database.
